Two of my peers and I created a process control block emulator for a school project. Coupled with error detection and correction, our program emulates the way operating systems handle the creation, deletion, execution, and modification of processes and their respective process control blocks.

Below you will find an explanation of the PCB block object, the execution algorithms we run our PCBs through, and how to navigate the program.
